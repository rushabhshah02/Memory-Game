# Memory Tile Game - Project
Author: Rushabh Shah
--> The Memory game has appeared in many different contexts,
    either as a computer game or as a card game that uses a partial or full deck of playing cards.
--> The player tries to find two matching tiles by selecting tiles from a rectangular grid.
--> This is a single person game that tracks the score of the player
    as the time taken to complete the game, where a lower score is better.
--> Multiple players can take turns playing the game and compete by comparing their scores.
